  In this project, I learned and implemented various concepts in React, including:

  - **Building reusable components**: Creating components that can be reused across different parts of the application to maintain code modularity.
  - **Props**: 
  - Passing props to components for better customization and flexibility.
  - Destructuring props inside components to simplify access to data.
  - **Mapping through an array of data**: Dynamically rendering components by mapping through an array of data and passing it as props to child components.
